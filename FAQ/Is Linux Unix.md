# Is Linux Unix?

URL: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001589.htm

**Linux** is often called "**Unix-like**" because it functions in much the same way as UNIX. For instance, it uses a command-line interface. Also, many of its basic commands have the same name and serve the same purpose, like those found in UNIX. 

However, **the Linux operating system is not directly descended from any of UNIX's code**. Additionally, it does not comply with the official single UNIX specification technical standard as defined by the Open Group.
