# Linux Distributions


## Intro

The **GNU/Linux Operating System** is built on the **Linux kernel**. To install `GNU/Linux` on your PC you could start with installing the **Linux kernel** and then **compiling and installing the GNU tools and other essential software** that makes up the operating system. This is not a trivial task and can require some sophisticcated computing skills.

- （1） 安装GNU/Linux需要两个过程：第一，安装Linux kernel；第二，安装其他软件
- （2） 这个过程很复杂

However we benefit greatly from the tremendous contributions many people have made to ensure installing `GNU/Linux` is accessible to everyone.

Many people over many years have put a lot of effort into packaging things together into **Distributions** so that **installing GNU/Linux is now straightforward**. Distributions typically provide the whole system as a collection of packages from which you can choose the packages to install to suite your own requirements. Some packages are mandatory, and form the base installation. Other packages are then installed as you need them.

Distributions方便了安装GNU/Linux的过程。

Up front, our recommendation is to install the `Ubuntu` distribution, which is based on `Debian GNU/Linux` and can come with vendor support from Canonical, though it is not a requirement. For a resource limited machine (an older server with 1GB RAM or less, for example) then `Lubuntu` is recommended. `Debian` is an excellent alternative choice.

## Distributions

`Red Hat` (now Fedora Core) is a good distribution and is quite popular for supported server-based environments with a focus on **the commercial server market** rather than **the desktop user market**.

`Debian`, more so than most other distributions, fundamentally conforms to the open and distributed development model, making it a very open distribution where even you can make a change to it, if you so desired.
