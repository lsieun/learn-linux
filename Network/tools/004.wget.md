# wget

The `wget` program allows you to download files from `URL`s. Although it can do a lot, the simplest form of the command is: `wget <some URL>`. 

Assuming no errors, it will place that file in the **current directory**. If you do not specify a filename, by default it will attempt to get
the `index.html` file.

```bash
wget www.baidu.com
```
