`Telnet` is an older protocol but is still used a lot today. It suffers from the same **security problem** as `FTP`; **it sends text in a non-encrypted format**. However, it is still useful in say **a lab environment** protected by a good firewall.

## 1. Install

### 1.1. Debian

telnet server

```bash
sudo apt install telnetd
```

telnet client

```bash
sudo apt install telnet
```

## 2. Connect

### 2.1. Connect Server

The command to start a Telnet session is `telnet hostname`. The `hostname` can be a name reachable on your network or a numeric IP.

```bash
telnet 192.168.80.136
```

之后再输出“用户名”和“密码”就可以连接了。

完整输出内容如下：

```txt
