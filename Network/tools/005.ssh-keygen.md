# ssh-keygen

Secure copy and Secure Shell are the best ways to copy files and to access remote machines. The `ssh-keygen` program allows one to copy files without a password. This works for `SSH` as well. For more information on this very cool feature run `man ssh-keygen`.

Follow these steps to allow the use of `ssh/scp` without having to enter a password. You will need to be `root`.

1. First, make sure the client has used `ssh` at least once. This will create the proper directory that is needed.
2. On the master machine run the `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command. This will create some necessary files.
3. If the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file does not already exist on the client, you can run `scp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <hostname>:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
4. Otherwise, copy the `id_rsa.pub` file over to the client and then add it to the `authorized_keys` file (I usually put it at the bottom).
5. You should now be able to `scp` and `ssh` to the client without having to enter a password. This is really handy, especially in scripts.

You can also add this entry to another user account. For example, I added it to my `/home/guest1/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. This way I can copy files as `root` from one machine, and it will still be accepted by the other.
