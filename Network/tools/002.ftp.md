# ftp

Not counting email, the two most common ways to copy files to another machine are `FTP` (**File Transfer Protocol**)and `SCP` (**Secure copy**).

FTP has been around for many years and is still used quite a lot today. However, standard FTP does have a serious drawback. The data is sent in what is called "clear text". This means a knowledgeable person could obtain the data under the right conditions.

The command to start an FTP session is `ftp server-name` where `server-name` can be a host name known on your network, or a numeric IP address.

```bash
ftp 192.168.80.136
```
