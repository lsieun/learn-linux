# uptime

Check the uptime on your computer and you might find the machine has not been rebooted for months or years.

```bash
server@cloud$ uptime
 00:55:30 up 265 days,  2:47,  2 users,  load average: 2.79, 3.58, 3.91
laptop@home$ uptime
 10:55:45 up 6 days, 17:02,  1 user,  load average: 1.37, 0.78, 0.39
```

Here's two variations of `uptime` for reference:

```bash
$ uptime -p  # Pretty print.
up 37 weeks, 6 days, 2 hours, 47 minutes

$ uptime -s  # Since.
2018-10-07 22:08:08
```
