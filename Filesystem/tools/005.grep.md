# grep

```bash
$ type grep
grep is hashed (/bin/grep)
```

```bash
sudo dmesg > demsg1.txt
grep Linux demsg1.txt
## The `-i` tells `grep` to ignore case
grep -i Linux demsg1.txt
```

Now run the folling command:

```bash
echo $?
```

Assuming the text was found, the return code will be 0. Now search for a string that should not be there, the return code should not be 0.

This might seem a little backwards, that zero means success and non-zero means failure. This is common to many Linux commands, because in many cases the number returned is an error code.
