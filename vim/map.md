# map

## Modifying key bindings

The main commands to know when dealing with key bindings are:
- `:map`: For the **Normal**, **Insert**, **Visual**, and **Command-line** modes
- `:imap`: For the **Insert** mode only
- `:cmap`: For the **Command-line** mode only
- `:nmap`: For the **Normal** mode only
- `:vmap`: For the **Visual** mode only

Each of the command takes **two arguments** â€” **the first** is **what keys the command should be bound to**, and **the second** is **the command to bind**.

```
:map <C-S> :w<cr>     #  using Ctrl-S to save a file
:imap <C-s> <esc>:w<cr>a    # 
```

Instead of `C` (Ctrl), you could also use `A` (Alt) or `M` (Meta). 
The `<cr>` at the end of the command is what actually executes the command. Without it, the command would simply be written to the command line but not executed.
