# locate

Now suppose we want to look for a file, but don't really know where it might be on the system. The `find` command is also slow at times, because it has to search the filesystem from the current point. Here's where `locate` comes in real handy.

## Install

Debian

```bash
apt show mlocate
sudo apt install mlocate
```

`mlocate` is a new implementation of `locate`, a tool to find files anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like `find(1)`, `locate` uses **a previously created database** to perform the search, allowing queries to execute much faster. This **database** is updated periodically from `cron`. 

Installing `mlocate` will change the `/usr/bin/locate` binary to point to `mlocate` via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may wish to run `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` by hand to create the database, otherwise `mlocate` won't work until that script is run from `cron` itself (since `mlocate` does not use the same database file as standard `locate`). Also, you may wish to remove the "`locate`" package in order not to have two different database files updated regularly on your system.

## Use

```bash
locate gnome-terminal
locate vim
locate ifconfig
## To ignore case do
locate -i sudo
```
