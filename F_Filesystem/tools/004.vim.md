# vim

`Vim` and `Emacs` are very powerful editors. They are most often used by programmers writing code and sys admins maintaining shell scripts.

From time to time, you may get into a text editing situation that seems hopeless. You have spent some time changing a file but now can't save it. The error is usually something like "**Permission denied**". There are usually **two things** that can cause this; **you can't write into the directory where the file is located**, or **the file already exists but not with the proper writeable permissions**. The best way to save your work, if the program allows it, is to simply write the file somewhere else, for example, in `/tmp`.

```bash
:w /tmp/lbookfake1.txt
```
