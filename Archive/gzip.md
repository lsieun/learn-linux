The `gzip` command is a common way of compressing files within Linux and therefore it is worth knowing how to compress files using this tool.

## 1. Command Basic: Compresse And Uncompress

### 1.1. How to Compress a File Using gzip

The simplest way to compress a single file using `gzip` is to run the following command:

```bash
gzip filename
```

Imagine now that you wanted to compress all of the images in a folder. You could use the following command:

```bash
gzip *.png *.jpg *.bmp
```

### 1.2. How to Keep the Uncompressed File

By default when you compress a file using the gzip command you end up with a new file with the extension `.gz`.

If you want to compress the file and keep the original file you have to run the following command:

```bash
gzip -k filename
```

### 1.3. How to decompress a File Using the gzip Command

If you have a file that has already been compressing you can use the following command to decompress it.

```bash
gzip -d filename.gz
```

或者

```bash
gunzip filename.gz
```

## 2. Command Advanced

### 2.1. Get Some Stats About How Much Space You Saved

The whole point of compressing files is about saving disk space or to reduce the size of a file prior to sending it over a network.

It would be good therefore to see how much space was saved when you use the `gzip` command.

The `gzip` command provides the kind of statistics you require when checking for compression performance.

To get the list of statistics run the following command:

```bash
gzip -l filename.gz
```

The information returned by the above command is as follows:

- Compressed size;
- Uncompressed size;
- Ratio as a percentage;
- Uncompressed filename.

### 2.2. Compress Every File in a Folder and Subfolders

You can compress every file in a folder and its subfolders by using the following command:

```bash
gzip -r foldername
```

This doesn't create one file called `foldername.gz`. Instead, it traverses the directory structure and compresses each file in that folder structure.

### 2.3. How to Test the Validity of a Compressed File

If you want to check that a file is valid, you can run the following command:

```bash
gzip -t filename
```

If the file is valid there will be no output.

### 2.4. How to Change the Compression Level

You can compress a file in different ways. For instance, you can go for a smaller compression which will work faster or you can go for maximum compression which has the tradeoff of taking longer to run.

To get minimum compression at the fastest speed run the following command:

```bash
gzip -1 filename
```

To get maximum compression at the slowest speed run the following command:

```bash
gzip -9 filename
```

You can vary the speed and compression level by picking different numbers between 1 and 9.

## 3. Compress Info

### 3.1. compress target

The `gzip` command will only attempt to compress regular files and folders. Therefore if you try and compress a symbolic link it will not work and it really doesn't make sense to do so.

### 3.2. compress filename

By default when you compress a file or folder using the `gzip` command it will have the same file name as it did before but now it will have the extension `.gz`.<sub>一般性的命名规则</sub>

In some cases, it isn't possible to keep the same name especially if the file name is incredibly long. In these circumstances, it will try to truncate it.<sub>特殊性的命名规则</sub>

### 3.3. compress ratio

Some files compress better than others. For example documents, text files, bitmap images, certain audio and video formats such as WAV and MPEG compress very well.<sub>注：压缩比例较高的文件</sub>

Other file types such as JPEG images and MP3 audio files do not compress at all well and the file may actually increase in size after running the `gzip` command against it.<sub>注：压缩比例较低的文件</sub>

The reason for this is that JPEG images and MP3 audio files are already compressed and therefore the `gzip` command simply adds to it rather than compressing it.<sub>注：解释原因</sub>
