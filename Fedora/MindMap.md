Labyrinth may not be intuitive at first. However, it is intended to be lightweight. It is also well-integrated with GNOME and runs smoothly. After you become familiar with the way it works, youâ€™ll be able to create simple mind maps and save them like maps or images.

Installation is easy using `dnf` along with the `sudo` command:

```bash
sudo dnf install labyrinth
```
