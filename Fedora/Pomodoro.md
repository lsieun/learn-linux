## Installing the Pomodoro timer

Fedora Workstation’s GNOME Shell has a Pomodoro timer extension available. To install it, search for Pomodoro in the Software tool, or run this command:

```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-pomodoro
```

To see the timer, hit `Alt+F2`, type `r` and hit `Enter` to restart the Shell. You can also logout and log back in, although you’ll need to save any of your work first. The timer will appear at the top right of your Shell.

You can use the **Preferences** panel to have more control over your sprints. There are some interesting options for sound (like a softly ticking clock) you might find energizing — or annoying! Use this control panel to adjust the intervals and interface to suit your preferences.

One of the custom options I like is the ability to start a sprint with a key combination. By default, `Ctrl+Alt+P` starts the timer, but you can adjust this as desired. Any time I hit a stride while writing and think a sprint is in order, I can use the keyboard to easily start and commit to one.
