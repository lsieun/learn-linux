Administrative scripts should emphasize **programmer efficiency** and **code clarity** rather than computational efficiency. This is not an excuse to be sloppy, but simply a recognition that it rarely matters whether a script runs in half a second or two seconds. Optimization can have an amazingly low return on investment, even for scripts that run regularly out of `cron`.

Shell scripts are typically used for **light tasks** such as automating a sequence of commands or assembling several filters to process data.
