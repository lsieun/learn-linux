# process list

The `ps aux` command lists the processes currently running and helps identifying them by showing their `pid` (process id).

Once the `pid` of a process is known, the `kill -signal pid` command allows sending it a signal (if the process belongs to the current user). Several signals exist; most commonly used are `TERM` (a request to terminate gracefully) and `KILL` (a forced kill).

The command interpreter can also run programs in the background if the command is followed by a “`&`”. By using the ampersand, the user resumes control of the shell immediately even though the command is still running (hidden from the user; as a background process). The `jobs` command lists the processes running in the background; running `fg %job-number` (for foreground) restores a job to the foreground. When a command is running in the foreground (either because it was started normally, or brought back to the foreground with `fg`), the `Control+Z` key combination pauses the process and resumes control of the command-line. The process can
then be restarted in the background with `bg %job-number` (for background).
