```

Replace the `[username]` with the required username

If you want to use `ps` then

```bash
ps -u [username]
```

OR

```bash
ps -ef | grep <username>
```

for the extended listing

## 3. pstree

Another alternative is to use `pstree` wchich prints the process tree of the user

```bash
pstree <username or pid>
```
