In ye olden days, these three items were **separate hardware**. **The console** was nothing more than **a monitor** and **keyboard**; it had **no computing capabilities**. It connected to a terminal, via a serial interface, the most common being the RS-232 connector.

**A terminal** is akin to an end-point to a mainframe. It usually had **some computing capabilities** and could communicate over a network, or some form of specialized connection, to a mainframe. A terminal also provided **administrative rights** to the system, which was why it was usually kept in a closed room. The consoles from the employees' area connected to these terminals, allowing them to work without having administrative access to the mainframe.

**Consoles** and **terminals** eventually merged in **a single device**, the most notorious being the **VT terminals** emulated in modern Linux distributions.

**The shell** is the actual program capable of reading the user's input and providing the result on the screen. A shell can be textual (like the CLI) or graphical (like Windows' GUI). In today's computing, a shell is much more than a simple interface between the user and system. It is responsible for managing processes, windows, applications, commands and other aspects of the system.

**The shell** interprets the commands entered through the command line, and a user can combine **multiple commands** into **a single script**. Modern shells have a scripting language of their own, providing the ability to perform complex decisions.

Most modern Linux distributions, as well as Mac OSX, use a shell, called `BASH`. Solaris and OpenIndiana use KornShell by default, which is another variant of `BASH`.
